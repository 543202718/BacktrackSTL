# BacktrackSTL

## Overview

BacktrackSTL is a novel seasonal-trend decomposition 
algorithm with O(1) complexity.
It utilizes simple methods such as smoothing and backtrack technique
to separately handle trend jumps, seasonality shifts and outliers.
It can decompose a value within 0.6us,
which is 40x faster than state-of-the-art OneShotSTL algorithm.
This repository contains the artifact of BacktrackSTL.
